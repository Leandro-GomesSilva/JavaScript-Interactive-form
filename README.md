# JavaScript: Interactive form
 The 3rd project on the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. In this application, JavaScript was used to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference. The application applies conditional behaviour to various input fields, validates user input and provides the corresponding visual indication in real-time.
 
 Main technologies: JavaScript<br>
 Auxiliary technologies: HTML, CSS<br>
 Complexity level: Beginner<br>
 Concepts: Input validation, Conditional fields, DOM manipulation, Regex, Event Object, Event listeners, CSS basic effects, HTML elements<br>

## For "Exceeds Requirements":
  - hid the "color drop down menu" until a T-shirt design is selected
  - added real time error notification (messages + design changes) for the following fields: name, e-mail, activities and credit-card
  - added conditional error notification for the e-mail field. You can test it using these e-mails:
    - noSpecialSymbols$$Before@gmail.com
    - noSpecialSymbols@AfterÂ§$%gmail.com
    - atSignMustBeIncluded
    - theDomainNameMustHave@twoOrThreeLetters.abcd
    - [leaving it incomplete] abcde@
    - [leaving it blank]

## Extras:
  - CSS improvements to increase user experience:
    - "red bad validation" design
    - "green good validation" design for the fields "e-mail", "card number", "zip code" and "cvv"
